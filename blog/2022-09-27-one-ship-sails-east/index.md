# Tis The Set Of The Sail or One Ship Sails East

by [Ella Wheeler Wilcox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Wheeler_Wilcox)

<!-- truncate -->

<br/>
But to every mind there openeth,<br/>
A way, and way, and away,<br/>
A high soul climbs the highway,<br/>
And the low soul gropes the low,<br/>
And in between on the misty flats,<br/>
The rest drift to and fro.<br/>
<br/>
But to every man there openeth,<br/>
A high way and a low,<br/>
And every mind decideth,<br/>
The way his soul shall go.<br/>
<br/>
One ship sails East,<br/>
And another West,<br/>
By the self-same winds that blow,<br/>
'Tis the set of the sails<br/>
And not the gales,<br/>
That tells the way we go.<br/>
<br/>
Like the winds of the sea<br/>
Are the waves of time,<br/>
As we journey along through life,<br/>
'Tis the set of the soul,<br/>
That determines the goal,<br/>
And not the calm or the strife.<br/>
<br/>
