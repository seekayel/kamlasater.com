# Some thoughts from AI Engineer Conf NY Feb 2025

<!-- truncate -->

### Agent definition from arize talk

- Router - classify prompt to 
- Skill - aka Tool
- Memory - store notes


## Jevons Paradox

Asserting that compute will exhibit jevons paradox style expansion in overall market size for reductions in price implies you believe something in the shape of demand curve. For a reducing in half of price means you would need to more than double demand.

I believe that demand for tokens is infinite given quality bars. Then the upper bound on price is close to human hourly wages.


## Humans will slow down adoption

Auditors are disencitivies from approving LLM usage in revenue critical contexts. Accepting that LLMs can work means they might must accept being displaced.


## Ai Snake oil talk
Early CS and Computer Architecture was about making computation systems more reliable (ENIAC tubes example). AI engineering is about becoming a reliability engineer.


## Anthropic How we Build Agents

1. Don't build agents for everything


# LLMs are like us
- unpredictable
- slow
- not great at math



## Ride the exponetial - Ramp director of AI
- Just call the LLMs ~50x, different models, slightly different prompts, validate the output is close.
- UI generated at call time

## Local Private

In the limit tokens are free and infinite quality. The only differentiator is the private context you bring.
