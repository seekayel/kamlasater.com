## Best of Times - Worst of Times

For Junior Developers it is the best of times and it is the worst of times...

Architects used to draw blueprints by hand. Then there was CAD. Old-timers complained about 3D modeling and how the next generation was getting ruined. How they weren't learning to think about buildings. How the profession would be wrecked by this new technology.

Nope.

Turns out clients didn't care if people were drawing by hand or on computers. The tools used to express creativity changed but the job to be done didn't change. People still wanted the creativity architects provide, just had different expectations in the how.

If you are a junior software developer, you get to skip the whole process of drawing by hand. You get to jump straight to using the new AI tools and agents to express the jobs to be done. You have just as much experience with these new tools as anyone.

Think of this as a gift. I've been a professional software developer for 21 years and we are competing on an equal footing for use of these new tools. Sure the tools have rough edges. Sure they are unwieldy.

But don't listen to dinosaurs that learned to draw by hand complaining about "the kids these days". They are asking you to buy into the experience that they have. Reject their resistance to change. Embrace the march of progress.

It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.
