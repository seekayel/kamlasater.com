## Abstract

Everyone is talking about agents and how powerful they are or will be. But what is an agent anyways? Down with corporate buzzword marketing speak, we are engineers, letâ€™s build!

In this talk we will build the minimal components needed to call an agent an agent. We will do this in a stepwise manner to see the effect of each additional element.

By the end of the talk we will have the simplest system that can be called an agent. It will include: planning, memory, tool calling all in a while loop. The goal is for you to leave realizing how simple agents can be. Maybe you have already built one.
