# How I Passed 9 AWS Certifications Tests in 14 Months

Here is how I passed 9 AWS certification tests in 14 months. All of these steps are needed. Let me know if you try them out and how they work for you.

## tldr: Process

  1) Be clear on **WHY** you are taking the exam(s)
  2) Set a goal of **WHICH** exam(s)
  3) Set a goal of **WHEN**
  3) **Register** for the exam
  4) **Tell** everyone about the exam
  5) Take **PRACTICE** tests
  6) **Pass** exam!

## Why

A **WHY** is important to keep focused and make sure you optimize for the outcome you are looking to achieve.

I would not recomend this challenge for someone who thinks they will get a job out of it, or a promotion. I did find it useful to understand a broader array of the AWS service offerings and it forced me to nail the basics.

At a past job, as a way to challenge myself and my team to dive into studying AWS I took on the challenge of passing all the AWS certification exams within 12 months. I used some elements of Ultra Learning which I was reading at the time.

My **WHY** was:

- Create a forcing function for me to learn AWS better
- Inspire my team to learn AWS better
- Test some techniques of Ultra Learning

## Which Exam

AWS is constantly changing the line up of their certifications. Depending on the current offering and your skills you may want to pick a different starting point.

My **WHICH** was in this order:

- Developer - Associate
- SysOps - Associate
- Solutions Architect - Associate

## When

## Register

## Tell

## PRACTICE

## Pass
