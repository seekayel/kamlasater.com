# [1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History][amazon-link]
By: Charles Bracelen Flood

# Summary

Lincoln worked very hard to preserve the Union. He also did it in such a steady
way. I'm left even more impressed with him as a president and man.

# Take Aways

Lincoln had to work very hard to be re-elected. The final result of the 1864
election might have been decisive. However going into the nominating convention
in Baltimore there was significant uncertainty. Lincoln was facing strong
internal challenges, including from members of his cabinet and generals.

Lincoln was walking multiple tight ropes at once:

- Henry Raymond of New York Times: Caught between radical Republicans on the one hand and so many
  of the Democrats on the other: "One denounces Lincoln because he didn't abolish
  slavery soon enough, another because he assumed to touch it at all."

- Pressing his generals (ie Grant) to take the battle to the enemy and take
  advantage of the Union's strengths in men and material; while at the same time
  avoiding unnecessary or costly loses.

- Wanting to fire or replace generals but have concerns that they could become
  political rivals. General Meade, opponent in the 1864 election, was only one
  example.

- Fighting a war but knowing he had to make peace. Pushing to win an
  unconditional surrender but knowing that for the Union to survive they
  couldn't "destroy the village to save it."


# Unanswered Questions

In reviewing the war casualty numbers I was reminded of how much more dangerous
disease was vs enemy fire. Often political winds seemed to shift and change
based on news from battles. However casualty rates were 2-3 to 1 for disease.
So even if there were a particularly deadly battle, the fact that the country
was at war was the thing that was deadly, not one particular
battle. I wonder if this was discussed at the time or if this was just thought of as the
background rate of disease of the day?
